==============If problems with building and running after compilation==============

Project Options-> Tasm -> Case sensitiviy -> All

Project Options-> C++-> Force C++ compile

If "unable to perfom incremental link", try alternate Build/Make until it'll work or restart builder.
===================================================================================

1)Install CBuilder6 - borland ver 6.0 (build 10.166), install service pack 6. 

2)disable UAC, disable/setup DEP. set admin rights to bcb.exe

3)creating manually folders
X:\intermediate_ed
X:\intermediate_ed\ae
X:\intermediate_ed\ecore
X:\intermediate_ed\core
X:\intermediate_ed\eprops
X:\intermediate_ed\le
X:\intermediate_ed\particles
X:\intermediate_ed\pe
X:\intermediate_ed\se
X:\intermediate_ed\sound 

3) Unpack from CBuilder6_stk_additional.rar folder Borland to C:\Program Files (x86) where y have builder.
This libaries for linking, converted to builder format, cause vs and build has different understanding of c++. (if y interested in details search in goolge: omf coff)

4) tools -> environment options -> environment variables  add your pathes there

DXSDK_DIR C:\STALKER_GAMES_SRC\STALKER\dx9sdk
XIPH_DIR C:\STALKER_GAMES_SRC\STALKER\SDK\Xiph\Include
EAX_DIR C:\STALKER_GAMES_SRC\STALKER\SDK\eax
ALSOC_DIR C:\STALKER_GAMES_SRC\STALKER\SDK\OpenAL\
ETOOLSSOC_DIR C:\STALKER_GAMES_SRC\STALKER\xray-svn-trunk\ETools
CORESOC_DIR C:\STALKER_GAMES_SRC\STALKER\xray-svn-trunk\xrCore
COMPONENTS_SOC C:\STALKER_GAMES_SRC\STALKER\SDK\components
SOC_SDK_DIR C:\STALKER_GAMES_SRC\STALKER
MAIN_DIR C:\STALKER_GAMES_SRC
SDK_DIR C:\STALKER_GAMES_SRC\STALKER\SDK

Устарело:
MAGIC_SW_DIR C:\STALKER_GAMES_SRC\STALKER\SDK\MagicSoftware\FreeMagic\include

5) you need to copy to windows\SysWOW64 or if you have XP or x86 to windows\system32

X:\STALKER\SDK\components\ElPack\bpl\elpackB6.BPL
X:\STALKER\SDK\components\ElPack\bpl\elpkdbB6.BPL
X:\STALKER\SDK\components\ElPack\bpl\elpproB6.BPL

6)component->install packages

you need to install:
*(outdated?) borland user components - Borland\CBuilder6\Projects\Bpl\dclusr60.bpl
editor - STALKER\SDK\components\AlexMX\editor.bpl
eldos DB Aware Controls - STALKER\SDK\components\ElPack\Code\dceldbB6.bpl
eldos Professional Components - STALKER\SDK\components\ElPack\Code\dcelppB6.bpl
eldos Visual Components - STALKER\SDK\components\ElPack\Code\dclelpB6.bpl
all this have borland itself and SDK src of stalker.

7)after installing of components reopening file of project

8)click on project you want to build, xrcoreb.dll for example->options->properties->linker
don't generate state files - enable disable during random bugs of compilation during linking
also whe y will have some random bugs try to do first make then build, it will have in 99% of cases.
